Q)
In awt we have only frame why we have contentpane in swing , why we need it and what is it actually ?

Answer
======
AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)
============================
In AWT, you typically work with Frame, Panel, and other components directly. You add components (like buttons, labels, etc.) directly to the Frame.

Swing and Content Pane
======================
Swing is built on top of AWT and provides a richer set of GUI components. Swing introduced a more flexible and powerful way to manage components within top-level containers like JFrame.

Why Use a Content Pane in Swing?
===============================
1.Separation of Concerns:
========================
	Top-Level Container: 
        ====================
	In Swing, JFrame is a top-level container. 
	It handles the window's borders, title bar, and window management.

       Content Pane: 
       =============
	The content pane is where you add your application's components 	(buttons, labels, panels, etc.). This separation allows better 	management and organization of components.

2.Layered Architecture:
=======================

Swing uses a layered architecture for its top-level containers. A JFrame contains several layers (like the content pane, glass pane, and root pane) that help in managing the components and their behavior.

The content pane is one layer specifically designated for holding the application's components. This design provides more flexibility and control over the GUI.

3.Consistency and Flexibility:
=============================

By using a content pane, Swing ensures a consistent way of adding and managing components across different types of containers (JFrame, JDialog, JApplet, etc.).

This approach allows more advanced features like glass panes (used for drawing or handling input events over the entire window) and root panes (for managing the hierarchy and layout of components).


What is a Content Pane?
=======================
The content pane is an instance of Container (or its subclass) where all the components of the Swing application are added. By default, the content pane is a JPanel with a BorderLayout layout manager.
