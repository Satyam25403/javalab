represent graph:

adjacency list: if x neighbours for a node, to find them O(x)

2d adjacency matrix: a[i][j]=1 means (i,j) edge is present in graph
here we store redundant info where edges dont exist i.e where the entries are 0:space used O(n^2)
even if if x neighbours for a node, to find them O(V) where V>=x is no of vertices

edge list: list of {src,dest,wt} (i,j,d) edges if i->j is present:this is used when we need to sort the edges in graph
like in minimum spanning trees

implicit graph:already given graph is representation of 2-d array






we will implement graphs as an array of arrayLists
ArrayList<Edge> graph[v];

this is optimized version as there is one such operation of finding neighbours in a graph which is very frequent
we will just access the index and start writing its neighbours with almost no complexions involved

i.e at every index of this graph we will be having an arrayList: to add neighbours of a vertex i
graph[src].add(new Edge(src,dest))

static class Edge{
    int src,dest;
}
